# Utopia-app

I created two activities (1st for user list, 2nd user details list)

I fetched only userIDs from the API's endpoint (/users) and placed them in the class Users.

I fetched all data from the API's endpoint (/todos) and placed them in the class MainActivity.

Maybe it was not a proper way to do it, because I didnt know how to push forward specified data to another activity. Probably by specifying  them. (I made a class users, but when i launch the app, they were duplicating, like userid:1 was duplicated for 20 times, because userid:1 contains 20 IDs.. and so on..).. so I fetched the data from /users (10 userIds in total)

Thanks,

Armin
